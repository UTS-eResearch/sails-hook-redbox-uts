    UTS offers a suite of different platforms to assist with managing your research data. These platforms meet standards for best practice Research Data Management (RDM) as required in the <a href="http://www.gsu.uts.edu.au/policies/research-management-policy.html" target="_blank"> UTS Research Management Policy (2018)</a> and further outlined in the <a href="https://staff.uts.edu.au/topichub/RIO%20Library/RIO%20documents/Research%20environment/New%20research%20directives/Research%20Management%20Guidelines/Guidelines%20for%20the%20Management%20of%20Research%20Data%20v0%2084%2020171120.pdf?Web=1" target="_blank">Guidelines for Research Data Management (opens in StaffConnect)</a>.
The platforms recommended here are hosted in Australia, mostly by UTS. Where they are hosted by other service providers, the service providers waive any rights over IP in the data stored. It is expected that researchers will use the supported University platforms as others may not comply with research data governance requirements. <br /> <br />
