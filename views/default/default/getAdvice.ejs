        <h4> Grant applications </h4> The ARC and NHMRC (among other funders) ask how you intend to manage your research data, and have recently made it clear that they are not looking for a generic response. <br /> <br />However, if you manage your data throughout the research lifecycle using Stash, you will be able to state that your data is managed via an integrated data management system that ensures compliance with the
        <a href="https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/r41" target="_blank"> Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research</a>. Stash also offers the ability to easily publish your data for reuse on the UTS Research Data website and <a href="researchdata.ands.org.au" target="_blank"> Research Data Australia</a>, whether openly or via mediated access.<br /> <br />
        <br /><h4> Data with sensitivities</h4> You may be required to provide information on how you will manage the security of your data. It is important to remember that data security is not just an IT issue but also needs to be addressed via well-developed data handling procedures (See the ABS explanation of the <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/1160.0Main%20Features4Aug%202017?opendocument&tabname=S" target="_blank"> Five Safes Framework </a> or contact <a href="mailto:eResearch-it@uts.edu.au"> eResearch </a> for help). Below you will find some statements about UTS IT and Data security and an example of how these might be used for a Clinical Trials, Health or sensitive data application. <br /> <br />  <br/>
        <h5>UTS IT Security Management: </h5>
        UTS has a policy directive covering IT security, based on the Information Technology — Security Techniques — Code of practice for information security management (AS/NZS ISO/IEC 27002:2006). This includes processes for the mandatory reporting of security breaches.
      </br /></br /></br /><h5>UTS Data centres: </h5>
        - applies to eResearch Store, LimeSurvey, Gitlab, Omero, Omeka and RedCap (which is stored in the offsite data centre only) <br> UTS research data is stored in two high security data centres: one onsite at UTS, with multiple security doors and strictly limited keycard access, and the other, offsite in a secure 3rd party data centre, approved by UTS Legal and with certifications including ISO 27001, ASIO T4 "Intruder Resistant" and PCI DSS.
        In both data centres, storage devices are kept in secure racks where only a limited team of approved UTS administrators can access the rack contents.
      </br /></br /></br /><h5> Data Security  </h5>
        <strong>eResearch Store (aka 'Isilon')</strong> offers granular access control down to User account level. eResearch fileshares are accessible via the UTS secure network, protected by a firewall. From offsite they can be accessed only via VPN. On balance, eResearch Store is the safest location for your data as it will be securely managed for the entire retention period.
        <br /><br /><strong>CloudStor</strong> is hosted by AARNET (the Australian Academic Research Network), is regularly penetration tested, and is accessible only to individuals with an Australian Access Federation (AAF) login. CloudStor encrypts all data in transit via TLS tunnels between the client and the ha-proxy off-loaders within the CloudStor environment. The CloudStor system encrypts all its storage drives and offers encryption at rest (Source: <a href="https://support.aarnet.edu.au/hc/en-us/categories/200217608-CloudStor" target='_blank'> CloudStor FAQs</a>). If you require a sync and share service or file transfer service, CloudStor is a reasonable option during the active research lifecycle and preferable to carrying sensitive data around on easily lost removable media or mobile devices. However, the master copy of the data should be saved to eResearch Store for long term storage. (NB. this is also the case for <strong>OneDrive</strong> which is is supported by IT Support rather than eResearch)
        <br /><br /><strong>eNotebooks (LabArchives)</strong> eNotebooks are hosted by LabArchives. LabArchives is a secure application on servers hosted at Amazon Web Services located in New South Wales. SSL certificates provide full-time HTTPS security for all User interactions with the application.
LabArchives has successfully passed network and application security tests from multiple vendors. Each customer's data is stored in its own database, isolated from other customer data.
Disk storage systems used for customer data utilise block-level "encryption at rest" via LUKS/AES/SHA256 and all backups of customer data reside only in an encrypted form.
Access logs are monitored regularly for malicious or unusual traffic.<br /> NB. Because eNotebooks keep an audit trail for IP Tracking purposes they shouldn't be used for data that must be deleted.
      </br /></br /></br /><h5>Example: for Clinical trials, Health and other sensitive data</h5>
        UTS research data is managed via Stash, a full lifecycle data management solution which records requirements for access control, retention, disposal and security level of research data. Sensitive data is stored on eResearch fileshares with granular access control. They are accessible only via the UTS secure network, protected by a firewall, or by VPN. The storage system is distributed across two high security data centres with strict physical and biometric access controls and a limited team of administrators. Data security at rest and in transit is managed in accordance with the UTS IT Security Policy, which is based on the ISO/IEC 27002:2006 Code of Practice for Information Security Management. For secure data collection and collaboration with researchers at other institutions, UTS researchers can also use REDCap, a FISMA and HIPAA approved platform.
